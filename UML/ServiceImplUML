In the above diagram:

The class DiscountCalculatorServiceImpl is represented inside a box.
The private fields EMPLOYEE_DISCOUNT_PERCENTAGE, AFFILIATE_DISCOUNT_PERCENTAGE, CUSTOMER_DISCOUNT_PERCENTAGE, DISCOUNT_PER_HUNDRED, and GROCERY_DISCOUNT_PERCENTAGE are indicated with a - symbol to denote their visibility as private.
The public method calculateNetPayableAmount(user: User): double is represented with + symbol to denote its visibility as public. It takes a User object as a parameter and returns a double representing the net payable amount.
The private method amountBasedDiscount(amount: double): double is indicated with a - symbol to denote its visibility as private. It takes a double amount as a parameter and returns a double representing the discount based on the amount.
This updated diagram reflects the additional implementation details of the DiscountCalculatorServiceImpl class, including the constants for discount percentages, the method for calculating the amount-based discount, and the logic for calculating the net payable amount based on the user's information and bill details.
