In the above diagram:

The class Bill is represented inside a box.
The private fields amount and item are indicated with a - symbol to denote their visibility as private.
The getter and setter methods for item and amount are represented with + symbols to denote their visibility as public.
The getter methods return the respective attribute types, and the setter methods take parameters of the corresponding attribute types.
This diagram illustrates the structure and interface of the Bill class, including its attributes and their access methods.

In the above diagram:

The class User is represented inside a box.
The userType can be customer , employee ,affiliate
The private fields membershipDuration, userType, and bill are indicated with a - symbol to denote their visibility as private.
The getter and setter methods for bill, userType, and membershipDuration are represented with + symbols to denote their visibility as public.
The getter methods return the respective attribute types, and the setter methods take parameters of the corresponding attribute types.
This updated diagram includes the Bill attribute in the User class, reflecting the association between the User and Bill classes. The User class has a composition relationship with the Bill class, as it contains a Bill object as one of its attributes.
